                    <p><b>books</b></p>
                    <p> i like to read books. a lot, actually. although these days i don't have as much time to read as i would like. </p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> <i>here are some that i have read in 2025 (mostly the summer) that i liked.</i> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara -- this one was intense. i had to stop in the middle twice. it made me feel a lot of things though and for that i enjoyed it.</li>
                        <li>In the Dream House by Carmen Maria Machado -- fantastic. she is so good at the deconstruction and reconstruction and the chopping up of stories while keeping you still hooked.</li>
                        <li>Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami -- my favorite murakami book so far. i love how detached he is about writing about our little mundane lives and how he can still make them feel as infinite as they feel. i need to get this one back from my friend who i lent it to.</li>
                        <li>Dance Dance Dance by Haruki Murakami -- i liked this one more than the first by a lot. cool dolphin hotel and cool teenage girl yuki and cool rock music. mundane man supernatural encounters.</li>
                        <li>Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami -- at this point it is evident i went on a murakami rampage. this was great. i liked it a lot. i like the simplicity of it all, but how it feels so big. i think i read it in a sitting on the staten island ferry back and forth and back and forth.</li>
                        <li>A Wild Sheep Chase by Haruki Murakami -- there is a page of this one that i adore. about the summer. and the mundanity of it all. the rest wasn't as good as dance dance dance.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p> <i>here are some that i have read in 2025 that i liked less.</i> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Hole by Hiroko Oyamada -- a little confusing and disturbing. short read. beautiful cover though.</li>
                        <li>Sputnik Sweetheart by Haruki Murakami -- not quite as colorful as the others. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p> <i>here are some that i started in 2025 but have yet to finish.</i> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>East of Eden by Steinbeck -- i will try.</li>
                    </ul>
